<p>TEI Boilerplate is a lightweight solution for publishing styled <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/">TEI</a> (<a href="http://www.tei-c.org/">Text Encoding Initiative</a>) P5 content directly in modern browsers. With TEI Boilerplate, TEI XML files can be served directly to the web without server-side processing or translation to HTML. Our <a href="http://dcl.slis.indiana.edu/teibp/content/demo.xml">“TEI Boilerplate Demo”</a> document illustrates many TEI features as displayed by TEI Boilerplate.</p>

<h1>Browser Compatibility</h1>

<p>TEI Boilerplate requires a robust, modern browser to do its work. It is compatible with current versions of Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer (IE 9). Some browsers may not allow XSLT processing on files opened from a file system. For best luck, you'll want to serve files through a web server. If you have problems with TEI Boilerplate with a modern browser, please let us know by filing a bug report at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/teiboilerplate/tickets/">https://sourceforge.net/p/teiboilerplate/tickets/</a>.  </p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>TEI is a language designed primarily to express the content of documents. Projects that use TEI are responsible for developing their own methods of augmenting or converting it to a presentation-ready state for the web. Two potential paths to reach this goal are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Converting the TEI to HTML and CSS via XSLT</li>
<li>Attaching a CSS stylesheet directly to the TEI XML</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these approaches have advantages and drawbacks. While HTML is the language of the web and, as such, is well supported browsers, its descriptive capabilities are much less expressive than TEI. This means that much of the data that project teams spend valuable time encoding is not always available within the context of the HTML document. However, the browser understands HTML very well and knows, for example, when to initiate retrieval of a document based on certain user events, such as clicking a link. The second option, CSS-styled TEI allows for all of the TEI data to be delivered directly to the browser. However, while the browser may apply CSS to format and style a TEI document, the browser does not understand the semantics of TEI. For instance, the browser does not understand that TEI's <code>&lt;ptr&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ref&gt;</code> elements are linking elements.  </p>

<p>TEI Boilerplate bridges the gap between these two approaches by creating an environment in which TEI XML delivered directly to browser, and styled by CSS, but features expected of web documents, such clickable links and display of linked images. We accomplish this by making use of the built-in XSLT (1.0) capabilities of browsers to embed the TEI XML within a minimal HTML5 shell document. The TEI XML document is embedded, with minimal modifications, within this HTML5 shell. To enable, for instance, working links and display of figures and images, a small number of TEI elements are transformed. </p>

<p>TEI Boilerplate is not intended to be a replacement for the many excellent XSLT solutions for publishing and displaying TEI/XML on the web. It is intended to be a <em>simple and lightweight</em> alternative to more complex XSLT solutions. There are both practical and theoretical advantages to this lightweight approach.</p>

<h2>Practical Benefits</h2>

<p>XSLT is far more powerful than CSS. It can manipulate data in ways that CSS cannot. XSLT can radically transform documents and can combine multiple XML data sources into a single output file or multiple output files. We at TEI Boilerplate love XSLT, but the power of XSLT comes at a cost. XSLT is a far more complex language than CSS, and it has a far steeper learning curve. There are relatively few expert XSLT programmers compared to the numbers of expert Web developers with extensive knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript. </p>

<p>On the other hand, JavaScript is an extremely capable language for doing fancy things with XML content. Javascript, JavaScript frameworks like JQuery and EXT JS, and the major browsers provide excellent support for manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model) of the web page. With TEI Boilerplate, the TEI document becomes part of the DOM. and JavaScript may then be used to perform more complex transformations, movements, and other manipulations of the TEI/XML content than can be achieved with CSS alone. Our <a href="http://dcl.slis.indiana.edu/teibp/content/demo.xml">“TEI Boilerplate Demo”</a> document includes a simple example in the "Toolbox," with a check box that uses JavaScript to hide and reveal the page breaks in a portion of the demo document. </p>

<p>TEI Boilerplate gives HTML5/JavaScript/CSS documents direct access to original TEI content, and it gives TEI documents direct access to the substantial capabilities of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, the dominant document format, programming language, and styling language of the web. TEI Boilerplate aims for simplicity and elegance, but it also facilitates complexity and innovation by exposing TEI content directly to capabilities of JavaScript, the many powerful JavaScript frameworks, and CSS. By embedding the TEI document in an HTML5 shell, the TEI document may take advantage of a host of web technologies and vice versa. </p>

<p>In teaching contexts, TEI Boilerplate may be a useful solution. Students and  scholars new to the TEI are rightly excited and enthused as they encode their first documents and experience the expressive power of TEI encoding. But too often that initial excitement and enthusiasm is dissipated when they inquire publishing their documents on the web and are confronted with sometimes overwhelming details about an unfamiliar programming language, XSLT, and other information about server side processing, transformation engines, and so on. With TEI Boilerplate, such individuals simply add a couple lines of code to their documents to allow modern browsers to produce formatted output of their TEI content. And that display may be further tweaked and customized using CSS.</p>

<h3>TEI Boilerplate and Omeka</h3>

<p>TEI Boilerplate is a simple solution for delivering TEI/XML documents through <a href="http://www.omeka.org">Omeka</a>. No additional software or plugins are necessary. One can simply simply host the TEI Boilerplate XSLT, JavaScript, and CSS files on a server (or as items in Omeka) and change any links to point to those online files.</p>

<h2>Theoretical Advantages</h2>

<p>The power of TEI lies in its the richness and expressiveness of its vocabulary. But much of that richness and expressiveness is lost in the translation to HTML. TEI Boilerplate largely preserves the integrity of the TEI document. Since the original TEI document is delivered directly to the browser, the source TEI can be easily accessed and saved to the desktop or mobile device.</p>

<p>Scholars labor over the intricate encoding of TEI documents, but then when those documents need to be rendered in a browser, they are thrown out and replaced by far less expressive HTML surrogates. Furthermore, the presentation of the document is targeted at the HTML surrogate rather than the intricately encoded TEI document. By exposing the TEI directly to the browser, if one wishes to manipulate the document using JavaScript, one may manipulate the TEI directly. Scholars are likely to be intimately familiar with their TEI documents, and their engagement with and understanding of these documents may benefit when the formatting and processing is targeted at the TEI itself, rather than an HTML surrogate.</p>

<p>TEI Boilerplate respects the integrity of the TEI document, and keeps the TEI document central throughout the publication process.</p>

<h1>How It Works</h1>

<p>When a TEI XML file that uses TEI Boilerplate is accessed by a browser, the browser reads a line (the <code>xml-stylesheet</code> processing instruction) in the file that indicates that the XML should be processed by the TEI Boilerplate XSL stylesheet. The browser then processes the TEI according to the rules of the stylesheet, which results in an HTML5 shell document stuffed with the TEI. A small number elements and attributes (e.g. <code>&lt;ptr&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ref&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>, and <code>@rend</code>) of the TEI are converted to HTML elements, so that links work and images are displayed. The HTML shell contains a link to the TEI Boilerplate CSS file, which tells the browser how to style the full document.</p>

<h1>Using it in Your Project</h1>

<p>Download the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/teiboilerplate/files/">TEI Boilerplate files</a>, and host the <code>teibp</code> directory on a web server.</p>

<p>The simplest way to use TEI Boilerplate (TEIBP) is simply to add your TEI files to the <code>teibp/content</code> directory of TEI Boilerplate and include the following xml-stylesheet processing instructions at the top of your TEI documents, after the XML declaration and before the root <code>&lt;TEI&gt;</code> element:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;?xml-stylesheet type="teibp.xsl"?&gt;
    &lt;?xml-stylesheet type="../css/teibp.css"?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You may then access your TEI files from a modern browser and see the resulting styled document.</p>

<h1>TEI Boilerplate and CSS</h1>

<p>TEI Boilerplate makes extensive use of CSS to generate styled documents in the browser. The CSS is drawn from three possible sources:</p>

<ul>
<li>External css stylesheets: <a href="http://dcl.slis.indiana.edu/teibp/css/teibp.css">teibp.css</a> includes default styles for the HTML shell and TEI document. <code>custom.css</code> is an empty stylesheet provided as a placeholder for user styles.</li>
<li><code>&lt;rendition&gt;</code> elements with <code>@scheme="css"</code> from within individual TEI documents are used to generate CSS declarations understood by the browser.</li>
<li>The global <code>@rend</code> attribute may be used to include inline CSS in TEI documents. The contents of <code>@rend</code> are copied to <code>@style</code> which is understood by the browser.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Customizing the Look</h1>

<p>TEI Boilerplate includes a default “theme” and some alternative themes. These are provided mostly as an illustration of TEI Boilerplate's capabilities. Users may modify these supplied themes in the following ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>By supplying <code>&lt;rendition&gt;</code> elements with <code>@scheme="css"</code> within the<code>&lt;tagsDecl&gt;</code> section of your TEI document. TEI Boilerplate will automatically convert the <code>&lt;rendition&gt;</code> elements into CSS declarations  in a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element of the HTML5 shell that surrounds the TEI document after the simple XSLT transformation. TEI elements that use the <code>@rendition</code> attribute to point to <code>&lt;rendition&gt;</code> styles will be styled accordingly. This mechanism is similar to using HTML's <code>@class</code> to point to CSS classes. See the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/HD.html#HD57">TEI Guidelines</a> for more details on <code>&lt;rendition&gt;</code> and <code>@rendition</code>. The TEI Boilerplate <a href="http://dcl.slis.indiana.edu/teibp/content/teibp.xml">TEI template</a> (<a href="http://dcl.slis.indiana.edu/teibp/content/teibp.xml">teibp.xml</a>) also includes examples.</li>
<li>By adding custom CSS to the <code>custom.css</code> file located in the <code>teibp/css</code> directory. he HTML shell created by TEI Boilerplate includes a link to the custom.css file. This file is empty by default. You may add user styles to this file.</li>
<li>It is possible, but not recommended, to edit teibp.css directly. This approach would require merging modifications with future releases of TEI Boilerplate.</li>
</ol>

<h1>The TEI Boilerplate Template</h1>

<p>An important component of TEI Boilerplate is a “boilerplate” <a href="http://dcl.slis.indiana.edu/teibp/content/teibp.xml">TEI template</a> (<a href="http://dcl.slis.indiana.edu/teibp/content/teibp.xml">teibp.xml</a>), a very simple TEI file, with some XML comments about where one might typically put basic information (e.g., title, author, bibliographic details of any source material). The most important features of the TEI Boilerplate template are:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <code>xml-stylesheet</code> processing instructions with links the TEI Boilerplate XSLT and CSS files,</li>
<li>a pre-defined set of <code>&lt;rendition&gt;</code> elements with generally useful styles for describing a source document or for use in a born-digital TEI document. For instance, the template includes styles for bold, italicized, underlined, and “normal” text; for left-aligned, right-aligned, centered, and fully justified text; for indentation of verse lines, block quotes; and so on. </li>
</ul>

<p>Users of TEI Boilerplate may choose to use the styles provided in the template, and add to, modify, or replace them. As explained above, <code>&lt;rendition&gt;</code> elements, along with <code>@rendition</code> and <code>@rend</code> are all used by TEI Boilerplate to produced styled documents in the browser. Thus, TEI authors may achieve substantial results by using these standard TEI features, without the need to edit any of the TEI Boilerplate code.</p>
